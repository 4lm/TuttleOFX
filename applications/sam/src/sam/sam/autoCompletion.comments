The auto-completion need to be enabled.
to enabling auto-completion, add in ~/.bashrc these lignes:

# auto completion
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
. /etc/bash_completion
fi

after, you need to run the script sam.sh (which can be called after these previous lignes)
then after type sam, do <TAB><TAB> and it answer:
cp do ls mv plugins etc.

just start to complete and continue with <TAB><TAB>
Enjoy the command ligne !
