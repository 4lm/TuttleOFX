TuttleOFX project is published under multi-licensing, so you can choose between:
* TuttleOFX Public Licence, version 1 (less restrictive version of LGPL), see LICENCE.TuttleOFX file.
* GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 (LGPL), see LICENCE.LGPL file.
* GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL), see LICENCE.GPL file.

This multi-licensing scheme applies to the whole project: applications, libraries and plug-ins.
But some plug-ins can specify another licence due to some dependencies. In this particular case, the plug-in will include a custom COPYING licence file that completely defines the rules for this plug-in independently from this file.
