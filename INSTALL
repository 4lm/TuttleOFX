Installing TuttleOFX


1.	First, download the last version of boost sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files

2.	Uncompress the files into the "3rd_party" directory
	e.g. TuttleOFX/3rd_party

3.	Rename "boost_X_XX_X" directory to "boost" (without versioning) or create a symbolic link
	e.g. TuttleOFX/3rd_party/boost

4.  Building the building tool : bjam
	
	BJam is Boost library's build tool. TuttleOFX uses it also as a project builder.
	
	In order to build bjam and boost libraries:
	Open a terminal and go to the TuttleOFX/3rd_party/boost folder. Then type:

		* under linux platform:
			
			bootstrap
			./bjam
			
		* under windows platform:
			
			bootstrap
			.\bjam
			
5.	Setting up environment variables

	In order to use bjam, two environment variables have to be set:

		PATH				- to locate bjam executable
		BOOST_BUILD_PATH	- to locate boost.build scripts

	This is done by adding:
			
		[/your/installation/path]/TuttleOFX/3rd_party/boost to the PATH variable.
		[/your/installation/path]/TuttleOFX/3rd_party/boost/tools/build/v2 to the BOOST_BUILD_PATH variable.
	
4.  Building TuttleOFX 

	In order to build TuttleOFX library (tuttle) and command line tool (sam), you can:

		cd to the TuttleOFX root directory and type: 
	
			bjam /tuttle /sam
	
		OR
	
		cd to the Jamfile location of a particular subproject and type:

			bjam

5.  That's all.



Usefull bjam command line options & properties:

* --help 					Display help message
* --clean 					Remove targets instead of building
* -a 						Build all targets, even if they are current
* --toolset=toolset			Indicates the toolset to build with [gcc|mingw|msvc|...]
* variant=debug|release		Select the build variant
* link=static|shared		Whether to build static or shared libraries
